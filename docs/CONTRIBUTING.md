2. Use the issue template when available
3. Include system information (OS, Python version)
4. Provide detailed steps to reproduce
5. Include log excerpts when applicable

### Suggesting Features
1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Open an issue with the "enhancement" label
3. Describe the use case and expected behavior
4. Consider implementation complexity

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Follow the coding standards below
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Submit a pull request

## üíª Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pr0Xy-chaIN.git
cd Pr0Xy-chaIN

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # (if available)

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Check code style
flake8 *.py
black --check *.py
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings for all public functions

### Code Structure
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle exceptions appropriately

### Example Function
```python
def validate_proxy(proxy: str, timeout: int = 10) -> bool:
    """Validate if a proxy is working.
    
    Args:
        proxy: Proxy string in format 'ip:port'
        timeout: Connection timeout in seconds
        
    Returns:
        True if proxy is working, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If proxy format is invalid
    """
    if ':' not in proxy:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid proxy format: {proxy}")
        
    # Implementation here
    return True
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test tool integrations end-to-end
- Use test fixtures for consistent setup
- Clean up after tests

### Test Structure
```python
def test_proxy_validation_success():
    """Test successful proxy validation."""
    manager = ProxyChainManager()
    result = manager.test_proxy("1.2.3.4:8080")
    assert isinstance(result, bool)

def test_proxy_validation_invalid_format():
    """Test proxy validation with invalid format."""
    manager = ProxyChainManager()
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        manager.test_proxy("invalid-format")
```

## üìñ Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Update docstrings for modified functions
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Document any breaking changes

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to DOCUMENTATION.md
- Update QUICK_REFERENCE.md for new commands

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security Testing
- Never commit real credentials or API keys
- Use test data for all examples
- Validate user input appropriately
- Consider security implications of changes

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
- Allow time for fixes before public disclosure
- Follow coordinated disclosure practices

## üöÄ Release Process

### Version Numbers
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update version in relevant files
- Tag releases appropriately

### Changelog
- Update CHANGELOG.md with new features
- Include breaking changes
- Credit contributors
